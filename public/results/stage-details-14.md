#### Distinguishing characteristics
While some members feel like they have resolved some issues and can collaborate well, some members are still not feeling safe to speak their minds in the teams. The team, therefore, needs to gather the whole team and focus on getting everybody on board in regards to feeling safe, and together get through stage 2, which is where the team gets everybody on board with goals, roles etc.
