#### What the team needs
The challenges of the team is then to figure out how the team can have stage 1 issues of dependency and inclusion if the team is otherwise mature.

A suggestion of excersices is:
1. [A Team Development Framework](https://proagileab.github.io/agile-team-development/guides/A-Team-Development-Framework.html)
2. [Team-Start Example](https://proagileab.github.io/agile-team-development/guides/Team-Start-Example.html)
3. [Journey Lines](https://proagileab.github.io/agile-team-development/guides/Journey-Lines.html)
4. [Team Vision](https://proagileab.github.io/agile-team-development/guides/Team-Vision.html)
5. [Build trust with simple questions](https://proagileab.github.io/agile-team-development/guides/Build-Trust-With-Simple-Questions.html)
6. [Team-agreement](https://proagileab.github.io/agile-team-development/guides/Team-agreement.html)



#### Distinguishing characteristics
To get matches on stages 1, 3 and 4 is very rare. A team that is mature should theoretically not have high values on stage 1.
