#### Distinguishing characteristics
To get matches on all stages is extremely rare. A team that is one collaborative unit should not be able to have focus areas in all stages. One known reason for such a pattern is if the team has a stable core and consistently get new members that join and leave within a short time period (usually within a couple of months). Having such a set-up makes it very hard to get a mature team over time.
