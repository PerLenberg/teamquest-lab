#### Distinguishing characteristics
- Known reasons for a result like this are at least two subgroups within the teams where some team members are in the first stage, and some others are in stage 2. 
- This means that some members feel they can express themselves freely and notice a period of disagreement while others feel they cannot express themselves and speak their opinion in the team. 
- The challenge is for the team to create a safe atmosphere for the people who hesitate to speak their minds (invite them to share their thoughts, but don't pressure them) and work on defining the overall goal/purpose of the team and figure out who can contribute with what in order to reach that goal. 
  
#### What the team needs
The team needs to get together as a whole. Note that this is a challenge in teams with more than around 10 members.
