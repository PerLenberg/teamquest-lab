#### Distinguishing characteristics
- The purpose of the team is not clear just like the formal and informal roles.
- There is a clear lack of structure and organization of the work being done.
- The team members depend on the appointed (or informal) leaders.
- The leaders are perceived as great without any enquiry. 
- The members do not feel safe to speak their minds.
- Members are careful and cautious in their communication. No open conflict.
- Ideas and proposals are not really assessed by other members.
- Most team members do not take part in decision-making.
