#### Distinguishing characteristics
To get matches on stages 1, 2 and 3 is very rare. A team that is quite mature should theoretically not have team members who do not feel safe to speak their minds, nor have lengthy conflict discussion but should have found effective conflict management strategies by now.

#### What the team needs
The challenges of the team is then to figure out how the team can have stage 1 and stage 2 issues if the team is otherwise more effective. The team probably consists of many subgroups and is not one collaborative unit, which means the team needs to get together as a whole.
